# HCI-Mobile-Application
**Andoid mobile application for HCI course of ECE NTUA,2020.**

For this assignment we had to choose one functionality of our smart home application that we considered the most characteristic for users to understand our concept and implement it with Android Studio. This functionality was supposed to contain more than one screen/layout and activity and connect with a database (dummy data).

With this app, the user can login and ideally control his smart home applications, turn them off and on with a simple button touch, and search for devices to see if their state is currently OFF or ON.
